# Reusable Components

reusable-components is a project part of the devchallenges.io FrontEnd Web Developer certification. It features a series of challenges from elementary to intermediate level of dificulty.
this challenge in particular is based on creating a reusable button, taking into account certain requirementes made by the "client".

## Approach

Firstly, i inspected the use cases, and conclude they werent homogeneus, so the solution is not completely reusable. Then, in mirrors of the next challenge, i made use of the react router functionality to make a navigation to the inputs page, which is the next challenge to complete in order to get the certification.
